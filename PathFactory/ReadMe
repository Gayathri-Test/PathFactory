**REFACTORING SCOPE **
************************************************************************************************************
1. Using Explicit Wait is a best practice but due to Time constraint , Static wait is been used in this project
2. The tests would fail when running Browser compatibility due to the same email is been used multiple times for Account creation . 
The Solution for this is: To create a method which generates Random Email everytime that method is been called 
3.Account Creation field values are been hardcoded which is not the best practice .
